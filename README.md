# spitor
-----------------------------
Spitor is a github repository containing text files with web crawl data.
You are free to use this in your search engine or anything else you would like to do with it.
To figure out what file you want:

Decide whether you want a large index or a small one. (If you want a short list, use 'sample' files!)
The filenames are formatted like this:

webcrawl-month-day-year.txt (or for samples, webcrawl-month-day-year-sample.txt.)

If you want to get the latest crawl, just use webcrawl-latest.txt. (latest does not work for samples)

As you can see, we don't have much here. More crawls are comming soon!
